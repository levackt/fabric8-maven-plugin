[[migration]]
= Migration from version 2

This version 3 of f8-m-p is using a completely new configuration syntax compated to version 2.

If you have a maven project with a 2.x fabric8-maven-plugin then we recommend you run the http://fabric8.io/guide/mavenFabric8Migrate.html[mvn fabric8:migrate] goal directly on your project to do the migration:

[source, sh]
----
# in a fabric8-maven-plugin 2.x project
mvn fabric8:migrate
# now the project is using 3.x or later
----

Once the project is migrated to 3.x or later of the fabric8-maven-plugin you can then run this `fabric8:setup` goal at any time to update to the latest plugin and goals.
