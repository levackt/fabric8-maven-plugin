[[fabric8:import]]
== *fabric8:import*

This goal imports the current project into the [fabric8 console] so that you can browse the source code via the web interface and associate a [Continuous Delivery] pipeline with the project to start automatic Continuous Deployment.

If you have a project on the file system then type:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
mvn fabric8:import
----

This goal assumes you have already enabled the `fabric8 maven plugin`. If you have not done so already then invoke the <<fabric8:setup>> goal first.

If no git repository exists yet for the current project then a new git repository will be created and the current code pushed into it so that it can then be built with Jenkins.

If the current project is a git clone from a remote repository then this goal will also try to setup a `Secret` in kubernetes to keep track of the user name and password/access code or in the case of SSH protocol with git the SSH key pairs.
