This goal stops the app that you deployed via the <<fabric8:deploy>> goal.

mvn fabric8:stop

This goal iterates through all scaleable resources generated by the <<fabric8:resource>> goal and scales them to a _replica count_ of `0` so that by the time this goal completes there are no running pods for this app.

### Removing all resources

Note that if you wish to completely remove all resources for your application then use <<fabric8:undeploy>> goal
